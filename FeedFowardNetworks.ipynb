    "Estimated time needed: 60 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview:\n",
    "In this hands-on lab, you will build a simple feedforward neural network to classify flowers in the Iris dataset into three categories: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The lab involves using Python libraries such as Keras, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will explore how different optimization algorithms SGD, Momentum, and Adam impact the convergence rate and overall model performance. This lab is designed to provide practical experience with deep learning concepts and expose learners to essential machine learning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lab, learners will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Load and preprocess the Iris dataset, including feature scaling and target one-hot encoding.\n",
    "Implement a feedforward neural network using Keras or TensorFlow.\n",
